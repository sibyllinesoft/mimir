# MIMIR PROJECT CONTEXT

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
**FIX THE MIMIR MCP SERVER** - Make it work with Claude Code for deep code analysis

## CURRENT STATUS
- ✅ Fixed MCP response format in server code
- ✅ Installed Mimir with correct MCP 1.0.0 version
- ❌ Claude Code still using old MCP server process - NEED TO RESTART MCP SERVER
- Response format serialization errors still occurring - old server still running

## CRITICAL ISSUE
The MCP server response format is incompatible with Claude Code. Error shows:
```
20 validation errors for CallToolResult
content.0.TextContent Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of TextContent
```

## SOLUTION APPROACH
1. Fix MCP response format to match what Claude Code expects
2. Ensure proper MCP version compatibility (1.0.0 vs 1.13.0)
3. Test the fixed server with actual tool calls

## DO NOT GET DISTRACTED BY:
- Code refactoring 
- Analysis of the codebase structure
- Other improvements to the project
- **THE GOAL IS TO FIX MIMIR MCP, NOT ANALYZE THE CODE**
