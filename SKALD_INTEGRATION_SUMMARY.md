# 🎯 Mimir + Skald Integration Complete

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

Successfully integrated **Skald** monitoring library with **Mimir** MCP server to enable deep research monitoring and NATS JetStream trace emission for real-time agent visibility.

### 🔧 Components Added

1. **MonitoredMCPServer** (`src/repoindex/mcp/monitored_server.py`)
   - Drop-in replacement for the standard MCP server
   - Skald `@trace_function` decorators for performance monitoring
   - NATS JetStream trace emission for real-time monitoring
   - Deep research analytics (question complexity, session tracking)
   - Comprehensive error tracking and performance metrics

2. **NATS Trace Emitter** (integrated in monitored server)
   - Real-time trace streaming to NATS JetStream
   - Configurable retention (100k messages, 7 days)
   - Automatic trace categorization by tool type
   - Structured JSON trace format for easy consumption

3. **Real-time Trace Viewer** (`scripts/trace_viewer.py`)
   - Color-coded terminal output for live trace monitoring  
   - Research session tracking and analysis
   - Performance metrics and bottleneck identification
   - Error highlighting and diagnostic information

4. **Docker Compose Monitoring Stack** (`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`)
   - NATS JetStream server with persistence
   - Monitored Mimir server container
   - Trace viewer for real-time monitoring
   - Optional Prometheus and Grafana integration

5. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Automated setup script (`scripts/setup_monitoring.py`)
   - Comprehensive configuration file (`monitoring_config.yaml`)
   - Docker containerization (`Dockerfile.monitoring`)
   - CLI entry point (`mimir-monitored-server`)

### 📊 Monitoring Capabilities

#### Tool Execution Monitoring
- **Comprehensive tracing** of all MCP tool calls
- **Performance metrics** (execution time, throughput)
- **Error tracking** with full stack traces and context
- **Session tracking** across multiple operations

#### Deep Research Analytics  
- **Question complexity analysis** (low/medium/high)
- **Evidence tracking** (source count, confidence scoring)
- **Research session flows** (search → ask → refine patterns)
- **Knowledge building patterns** (how queries build on each other)

#### Real-time Visibility
- **Live trace emission** to NATS JetStream
- **Color-coded trace viewer** for immediate feedback
- **Research pattern recognition** and insights
- **Agent coordination monitoring**

### 🚀 Usage

#### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
python scripts/setup_monitoring.py --install-deps

# Start monitoring stack  
python scripts/setup_monitoring.py --start-stack

# Use monitored server (drop-in replacement)
mimir-monitored-server

# View live traces
python scripts/trace_viewer.py
```

#### Integration with Claude Code
The monitored server is a drop-in replacement - simply use `mimir-monitored-server` instead of `mimir-server` in your Claude Code MCP configuration.
