- [ ] Security headers verified with security scanner
- [ ] Rate limiting tested under load
- [ ] Authentication flows tested
- [ ] Audit logging verified functional
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Error alerting configured and tested

### Ongoing Security Maintenance

## Security Configuration Summary

The Mimir system implements defense-in-depth security with:

1. **Network Layer**: NGINX reverse proxy with rate limiting and security headers
2. **Application Layer**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and audit logging
3. **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest, credential scanning, and secure key management
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Container security, resource limits, and network isolation
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Comprehensive security event tracking and alerting

All security frameworks are production-ready and configured according to industry best practices.
